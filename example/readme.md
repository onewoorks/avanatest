#disclaimer

this example is for testing purpose only...

the parameter of filetovalidate is the filename to be validated.
parameter to be assigned to the method is hardcoded

Type_A.xlsx and Type_B.xlsx files is already in the hosting. Where Type_C.php is file will not be validated by current method.

if you want to test different file please run to your own development server and map the path of file name accordingly, 
**assuming you already know how to map the path to the function/method parameter
